Implemented the encoding and decoding message functions.
Solved few errors that were encountered during the implementation.

Planning to finish implementation and integrate with web-app.
Also planning to do the 7th bit implementation which would make the encoding more secure.
Planning to use SHA-256 encoding to encrypt the text.
