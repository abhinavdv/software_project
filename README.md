An image steganography implementation using the 8th bit and 7th method in opencv, Python

# What is image-steganography?
The word Steganography is derived from two Greek words- ‘stegos’ meaning ‘to cover’ and ‘grayfia’, meaning ‘writing’, thus translating to ‘covered writing’, or ‘hidden writing’. 
Steganography is a method of hiding secret data, by embedding it into an audio, video, image or text file.
It is one of the methods employed to protect secret or sensitive data from malicious attacks.
